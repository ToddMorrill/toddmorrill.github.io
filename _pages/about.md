Hey there! My name is Todd Morrill.

I'm currently an MS in Computer Science graduate student at Columbia University and also doing machine learning research advised by Professor [Richard Zemel](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/). I am interested in developing machine learning systems that draw inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science.

I currently live in New York City with my girlfriend and our sheepadoodle, Ziggy. Outside of work, I like to hike, camp, ski, and cook. In a former life, I loved to study languages and still speak Mandarin Chinese well enough.
