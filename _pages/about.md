Hey there! My name is Todd Morrill.

I joined a team of data scientists at my employer PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2015 and never looked back. I took 11 math and CS classes through Columbia University and Harvard Extension School while working full-time. I'm now an MS in Computer Science graduate student at Columbia University.

I have led and delivered countless machine learning projects. For example, I have developed document retrieval systems (i.e. search), information extraction systems, and knowledge-graph enabled applications, to name a few. Please see my resume for a more detailed list of projects.

I hope that a masters in CS will serve as preparation to pursue a PhD in CS or for further work in industrial research. I am particularly interested in knowledge representation & reasoning and view it as a critical component to advancing deep learning systems from their current state.

I currently live in New York City with my girlfriend and our sheepadoodle, Ziggy. Outside of work, I like to hike, camp, ski, and cook. In a former life, I loved to study languages. I still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=330&v=cLvqsdHSou0&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">speak Mandarin Chinese</a> well enough.
