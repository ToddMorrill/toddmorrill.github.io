<h2> About me </h2>

<p>Hey there! My name is Todd Morrill.</p>
<p>
	In August, 2015, I joined a team of
	data scientists in an AI innovation lab at PwC. Our mandate is to explore the technical and commercial feasibility
	of
	new AI and machine learning tools and techniques. I'm still not sure why they hired me but the hard work has paid
	off
	and I feel less and less imposter syndrome everyday.
</p>
<p>
	Over the past 4 years I jumped into math, statistics, and computer science. Outside of my day job building deep
	learning models for clients
	I have been fortunate enough to taking some rewarding classes, namely: Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra,
	Probability, Data Structures & Algorithms, and
	Systems Programming and Machine Organization. I can't say enough positive things about Harvard Extension School. These
	<i>are</i> the undergraduate classes
	are classes currently taught at Harvard so it's been fun to be a part of that.
</p>
<p>
	I currently live in New York City. After finishing up a couple more classes, I hope to pursue a masters degree or
	PhD program (if they'll have me!!). All views expressed on this site are my own.
