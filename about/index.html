<h2> About me </h2>

<p>Hey there! My name is Todd Morrill.</p>
<p>
	In August, 2015, I joined a team of data scientists in an AI innovation lab at PwC. Our mandate is to explore the technical and commercial feasibility of new AI and machine learning tools and techniques. I'm still not sure why they hired me but I feel less and less imposter syndrome everyday.

<p>
	Through my work, Harvard Extension School, and countless blog posts, I've learned the fundamentals of math, statistics, and computer science. Outside of my day job building deep learning models for clients I have taken the following courses: Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Data Structures & Algorithms, Systems Programming and Machine Organization, and Discrete Mathematics.
</p>
<p>
	I currently live in New York City. After finishing up a couple more classes, I hope to pursue a masters degree or PhD program. All views expressed on this site are my own.
