<h2> About me </h2>

	<p>Hey there! My name is Todd Morrill.</p>
	<p>
	Over the past 2 years I have discovered a latent passion for math, statistics, and computer science. In August, 2015, I joined a team of data scientists in an innovation lab at PwC. Our mandate is to explore the technical and commercial feasibility of new analytics solutions as they relate to machine learning/deep learning models, big data solutions, and new computing capabilities. We split our time between exploration of new capabilities from leading research labs and application of these solutions with clients and other teams at PwC. All views expressed on this site are my own.

	In August 2015, I had no programming experience and only a vague sense of what machine learning was. Within 3 months, I had learned to program and implemented my first Markov model on hundreds of gigabytes of data to model the most likely sequence of car part failures for a big 3 auto manufacturer. Since then, I have programmed nearly every day and spend at least a part of my day filling in the missing gaps in my knowledge. I have taken online courses on Coursera, Udacity, EdX, watched countless YouTube channels (shoutout to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex" target="_blank">SentDex</a>) to understand topics ranging from linear algebra to backpropagation in neural networks.

	Languages are relatively easy to learn in my opinion - I speak Chinese and some Italian - and Python came easy. Math is more nuanced and requires more critical thinking. Given the need to keep pace with the developments in the machine learning community and the need to speak and act intelligently for the clients that I serve, I want to solidify my understanding of some of the fundamentals. I read approximately one new research paper each week filled with LaTeX, some of which has become more obvious with time. However, I believe formal study is necessary to truly appreciate how Generative Adversarial Networks tick, as an example, among the many other algorithms that I work with daily. That's where I'm at now - the steady grind of figuring out how math and computer science work.

	It's amazing what you can do without a degree. I hope you'll find something interesting on this blog and be inspired to not let any formalities (e.g. degrees) get in the way of learning to code or do data science.
