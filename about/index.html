<h2> About me </h2>

<p>Hey there! My name is Todd Morrill.</p>
<p>
	In 2015 I joined a team of data scientists in an industrial artificial intelligence (AI) research lab at PwC. Our mandate is to explore the technical and commercial feasibility of new AI and machine learning (ML) tools and techniques. I now have ~6 years of hands-on experience building ML systems and researching new ways to use ML to solve problems. My job has necessitated that I work on a number of different ML sub-domains, hence the varied interests and topics on this blog.
</p>
<p>
	Outside of my day job, I have taken the following courses through the Harvard Extension School: Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Data Structures & Algorithms, Systems Programming and Machine Organization, Discrete Mathematics, and Theoretical Computer Science.
</p>
<p>
	I currently live in New York City. Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor activities including hiking, camping, snowboarding/skiing, and running. In a former life, I loved to study languages. I still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=330&v=cLvqsdHSou0&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">speak Mandarin Chinese</a> quite well.
</p>
<p>
	<b>I just applied to PhD programs in Computer Science (for Fall 2021 admission) and am seeking an advisor!</b>
