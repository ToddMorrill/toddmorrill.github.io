TLDR; I recently attended <a href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/" target="_blank">KubeCon</a>, where I learned about how Kubernetes is being used for machine learning model development.

Here are my high-level takeaways from the experience (2-minute read).
1. Very dev-centric and open source community - this was my first “developer” conference and as such the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2NDs-iu8WU5fMxINxHXlien" target="_blank">talks</a> were fantastic. Every talk that I attended got to the crux of the technology, whether it was managing the state of your K8s application or the control-flow semantics of gRPC.
1. The ecosystem is fragmented and many parts are at version < 1.0. There are many new startups and projects focusing on one narrow piece of Kubernetes infrastructure. For example, it seemed like there were several Message Queue startups/projects (e.g. NATS vs. KubeMQ) all doing the same thing. Well-resourced tech firms (e.g. Lyft, Snap, etc.) are creating workarounds for basic things (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPnCo-LG04" target="_blank">Snap</a> customizing Kubeflow for artifact caching - brilliant!). These projects will likely to consolidate and mature rapidly within the next 1-2 years. Stay tuned but tread lightly lest you invest a lot of time and energy into something that goes bust in the next 6 months.
1. It was a very welcoming environment with a heavy emphasis on attendee comfort. The conference offered group runs, yoga, a quiet room, a new initiative called <a href="https://osmihelp.org/" target="_blank">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a>, and a puppy paw-looza (therapy dogs came to the event one night). Another interesting experiment (albeit not-so successful) was to issue red, yellow, and green stickers to express your social interaction preferences (see photo above). Green was “Talk to me”, yellow was "Just those that I know”, and red was “Not at this time”. I didn’t see any red stickers out there but it gives you a sense of the lengths the organizers went to accommodate everyone.
1. There wasn't much content in the AI/ML/data analytics space beyond <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/" target="_blank">Kubeflow</a> (the 800 pound Gorilla in the room). There are two ways of looking at this:
    - the organizers could have done a better job bringing in more diverse presenters to cover topics like Spark or Dask on Kubernetes.
    - we should be really grateful to the community for giving Kubeflow so much attention and being so dedicated to its success.
<br>
<br>
I still would have liked to see a few more hands-on sessions on some sample workflows (e.g. distributed training job, hyperparameter tuning job, etc.).
1. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/" target="_blank">Minikube</a> is a great place to start if you want to experiment with Kubernetes on your laptop! I still need to dig into <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs/" target="_blank">MicroK8s'</a> strengths and weaknesses as well.
1. The one talk that really stood out to me was called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEGdSLWdrH0" target="_blank">Realizing End to End Reproducible Machine Learning on Kubernetes</a> by the **phenomenally** talented engineer, Suneeta Mall from Nearmap. It's worth the watch if you've ever been curious about determinism in Deep Learning systems.
